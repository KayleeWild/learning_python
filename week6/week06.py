credits = 110

#### Boolean variables can be assigned directly
can_graduate = True  # should be True or False to be a boolean

# write an expression to determine what the value of can_graduate
# should be if you can graduate if you have 120+ credits and a gpa above 2.0
can_graduate = credits >= 120 and gpa >= 2.0  # replace None with a condition (or complex condition)
print(can_graduate)

# Note: a good boolean variable name will indicate that it only has two possible values (T/F)

#### Logical operators (and, or, not) and complex conditions
# be careful with complex conditions (ones with and/or)
x = 4
y = x == 5 or 2  # this doesn't work the way you probably think it will
print(f'{y=}')
y = x == 5 or x == 2  # this works!
print(f'{y=}')


# logical operators have an order of operations too 
# not, and, or - see table
